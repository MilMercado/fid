  <h2>About Jen's Kitchen : "An Inside Bistro Scoop!"</h2>
  <p>
   <br>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself.
   <br>In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i>
   <br>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources.
   <br>One day, I hope to include a section of fellow restaurant reviews. If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.
