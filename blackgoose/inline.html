    <article><header><p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="20161115">November 15, 2016</time></p></header> <h2>Low and Slow</h2><p>This week I am <b>extremely</b> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
    <br>
    <br>In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide Salmon</i> with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.<p><p>blackgoose@example.com<br><b>555-336-1800</b><p>Â
